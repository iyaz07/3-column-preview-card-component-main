## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The project particularly helped me to learn more about Boder-style, Border-radius, etc.
```css
p{border-top-right-radius: 17% 55%;}
```

### Continued development

Im getting better with flexbox by the day, although i still doubt I can work with grid as well, I look forward to working on more projects. I also lok forward to getting better with time take to complete each project.


### Useful resources

- W3C ofcourse
